Meghan Markle's (bottom right with her father) hugely anticipated wedding dress will set the Royal Family back £100,000. Multiple royal and fashion industry sources have revealed the actress has opted for British couturiers Ralph & Russo to make the first of two gowns she plans to wear on May 19. She will wear the hand-stitched, heavily beaded design (middle) to walk down the aisle at St George's Chapel in front of 600 guests - and an estimated billion TV viewers worldwide - as well as for the reception being held afterwards by the Queen in St George's Hall at Windsor Castle. Another source revealed that the dress would cost around £100,000, which will be met by Prince Harry (with Meghan left at a charity fair in Nottingham and top right at Invictus Games closing ceremony in Canada) and his family privately. It has also been announced that Meghan's parents will meet the Queen, Charles and Camilla ahead of the wedding and her father will walk her down the aisle. Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Mia Tindall are believed to be among the bridesmaids and pageboys, who will all be children. The Duchess of Cambridge will attend without her newborn son Prince Louis and 96-year-old Prince Philip hopes to attend but it still recovering from his hip replacement operation.
